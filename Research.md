### _Brassica napus_ pan-genome
    
![](figures/hic.png)
Combine Pacbio, HiC, and Bionano sequencing to _de novo_ assemble high-quality genomes of two subspecies of _Brassica napus_: Siberian kale and rutabaga. Subsequently, we will construct species level _B. napus_ pan-genome, and further investigate the association between SVs, PAVs, and agronomic traits. The Hi-C scaffolding protocol can be find on [GitHub](https://github.com/Bio-protocol/Plant_genome_Hi-C_scaffolding).  
      
     
### _Brassica napus_ origin and diversification
    
![](figures/network.jpg)
Study the origin and diversification of _Brassica napus_ (canola, rutabaga, and Siberian kale), use bioinformatic approaches to explore hundreds of RNA-seq and GSS(Genome Survey Sequencing) data to study the genetic structure, admix/introgression history, and detect the important genes contributing to _Brassica napus_ different morphotypes formation. Paper can be find at [Nature Communicaitons](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10757-1).
    
    
### _Brassica rapa_ domestication and its polyploidy efforts

Domestication process and selective sweeps of _Brassica rapa_ (turnip, pak choi, napa cabbage _et al._), discover genes functioned in important agricultural traits, and their relationship with the whole-genome duplication events (WGD). Paper can be find at [Molecular Ecology](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mec.14131) and [New Phytologist](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nph.17194).
   
    
### _Brassica napus_ CMS mechanism

Comparative transcriptome analysis of a RIL line based on RNA-Seq help us understand the Differentially Expressed Genes(DEGs) between fertile and Cytoplasmic Male Sterility(CMS), and propose the mechanism of Polima CMS. Paper can be find at [BMC Genomics](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2164-15-258).
