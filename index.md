# Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Plants

I am currently a Data Scientist with [Bioinformatics and Analytics Core](https://bioinformatics.missouri.edu/) at the University of Missouri.   
   
Before that, I earned both my BSc and Ph.D. at Huazhong Agricultural University. Then I was a Postdoctoral Fellow and Research Scientist working with [J. Chris Pires](https://bondlsc.missouri.edu/person/j-chris-pires/) at the University of Missouri to study the domestication and diversification process of different Brassica crops by integrating multiple bioinformatic and genomic tools.
